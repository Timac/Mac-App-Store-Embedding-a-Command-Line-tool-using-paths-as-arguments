# Blog post

This code goes along the blog post available at [https://blog.timac.org/2021/0516-mac-app-store-embedding-a-command-line-tool-using-paths-as-arguments/](https://blog.timac.org/2021/0516-mac-app-store-embedding-a-command-line-tool-using-paths-as-arguments/)

A couple of months ago, I released a new app called [Dependencies](https://apps.apple.com/app/dependencies/id1538972026) on the Mac App Store. You can download and try it for free at [https://apps.apple.com/app/dependencies/id1538972026](https://apps.apple.com/app/dependencies/id1538972026). 

In this blog article, I explain how I built the command line support and released it in the Mac App Store. Implementing this feature turned out to be tricky, mostly due to the lack of documentation on this specific subject. This post might be of interest if you are planning to add a Command Line tool to your app distributed on the Mac App Store.
